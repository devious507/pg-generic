As an amenity to our guests, we provide high speed internet
access (HSIA). The HSIA service is provided by an
independent contractor.&nbsp; While we pay for the service,
we do not control the company providing the internet service
nor the system which the company uses to provide wired, or
wireless, HSIA to the guest rooms and public areas.

As you know, there are inherent security and privacy risks
associated with accessing or transmitting information over
the internet, whether wired or wireless connections are
used. If you use the HSIA service that we provide, you are
doing so at your own risk. Also, if you use the HSIA
service, you are agreeing that neither we, nor the internet
service provider, are liable for any loss of data, file
corruption, hacking, or any damage to your computer, or its
software. Unless you agree to these terms, you are not
authorized to log on to the internet.

Remember, wireless systems are especially insecure. Only
noncritical e-mail and basic internet surfing should be
accessed using a wireless system. Do not make any internet
purchases, or do anything that could expose you to liability
or potential identity theft, such as checking bank records
or credit card statements, on wireless systems. A hacker may
be nearby to intercept your password and steal information
from you. The actions of such hackers are beyond our
control.</textarea>
